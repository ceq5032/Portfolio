        <p id="borderimg2"> Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Chelsea and I am a fulltime student at Penn
            State Behrend. I currently am working towards my degree in DIGIT - Digital Media Art and
            Technology. I am 34 years young and married! I enjoy being outside as much as I can but
            when the weather is bad I love to sit inside and watch a scary movie or play my video
            games. </p>
